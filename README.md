The body fat percentage is a measure of fitness level, which can be calculated as the total mass of fat divided by total body mass. In this project, a simple, robust, and accurate method to estimate the percentage of body fat using available measurements is proposed, related to man's weight, circumferences of abdomen, and thigh. We will follow several steps such as data cleaning, model building and selection, and model diagnostics. The final measurement will be a linear model with three variables which are the circumference of the abdomen, the circumference of the thigh, and body weight.
